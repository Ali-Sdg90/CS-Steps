        <h3>Guideline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content
                before setting a deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                For each study item and each task, you should post an update to
                LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
                <code>#cs_internship</code>, <code>#[courseName]</code>,
                <code>#[stepNumber]</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a
                report including the following items:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Links to all your posts during the last week specifying
                        the relevant task or study item for each link, and also
                        mention the exact date that each one of them was posted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last
                        week?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                You will have a session with a mentor based on your report.

            8 videos for the "Communication Training" course. Here are the
            links:<br />

            <strong>Think</strong>, <strong>Write</strong>, and
            <strong>Talk</strong>.<br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Watch</strong> the specified video. Watch it deeply!
                    Make sure you have settled in a proper environment and
                    situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest
                    focus on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Think</strong> about the discussed concepts in this
                    video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and
                    find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Write</strong> a report about what you understood

                        <li>
                            Write your understandings of the proposed concepts
                            in the video.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        <li>

                            video.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Finally, send your report to your mentoring intern to set a
                    meeting for the next sprint. In this meeting, try to

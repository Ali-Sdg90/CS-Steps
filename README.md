<h1>CS-Steps</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to the CS-Steps repository! This repository serves as a
    comprehensive documentation of my progress throughout the CS Internship
    program. As a web intern, I will be sharing my journey through the 10 steps
    (plus an additional Step 0) required to successfully complete the
    internship. Each step consists of study items, tasks, and a 20-minute
    presentation about what I learned in that step, which I need to complete in
    order to qualify for the next step.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
<p>The repository is structured as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps</strong>: This directory contains folders for each
            step that I have completed so far. Each completed step folder
            contains the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Pre Step</strong>: This folder includes the tasks that I
                completed before officially starting the step.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step Sum</strong>: A file summarizing all of my posts
                related to the step, including my contributions to social media
                platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Twitch</strong>: This folder contains the link to the
                recording of my 20-minute presentation for each step. These
                presentations highlight the knowledge and skills I have acquired
                during the step, along with the files I used for the
                presentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 0</strong>: This folder is unique as it represents an
            additional step before the official Step 1. It contains an
            additional subfolder named "Interviews," which collects information
            about the first interview for the CS Internship program. I have also
            consolidated my posts about the interview into a single HTML file,
            allowing easy access to each intern's IDs with just one click. This
            file is continuously updated as new interns join the program.

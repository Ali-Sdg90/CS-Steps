        <h2>Step 5. Design Pattern</h2>
        <h3>Guideline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content
                before setting a deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                For each study item and each task, you should post an update to
                LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
                <code>#cs_internship</code>
                <code>#[courseName]</code>
                <code>#[stepNumber]</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a
                report including the following items:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Links to all your posts during the last week specifying
                        the relevant task or study item for each link, and also
                        mention the exact date that each one of them was posted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last
                        week?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                You will have a session with a mentor based on your report.

            of people in this club willing to help you. But how? How can you get
            help from them? Who is who!? Who knows what!? This is your first
            task, you should talk (literally talk on the phone or Skype) and get
            to know each other.

                    Throughout the course, you need to be expressing yourself
                    (emotions and knowledge) on social media. So go ahead and
                    create some social media accounts if you don't already have.

                    Introduce yourself and ask them to introduce themselves.
                    Within each conversation, you should achieve these goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Introduce yourself, so they will be able to introduce
                        you to the others later in the club.
                    </li>
                    <li>Get to know them by asking about:</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Who they are</li>
                        <li>
                            What their background is (technical and
                            non-technical)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What kinds of technical questions you can ask them
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Then, after knowing each person, you should take your time
                    and share your knowledge and feelings about them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Post a brief introduction about them on Telegram (a
                        summary of their answers to the 3 questions above) using
                        #معرفی #cs_internship #courseName #stepNumber tags and
                        mention the name of the person you introduce using
                        @NameOfThePersonYouIntroduce.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tweet your feelings about them using #معرفی
                        #cs_internship #courseName #stepNumber and mention the
                        name of the person you introduce using
                        @NameOfThePersonYouIntroduce.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Finally, you should ask (and convince) 5 of them to
                    introduce you in the club by posting a paragraph about you.
                </p>
